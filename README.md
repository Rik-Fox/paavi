Pedestrian and Autonomous vehicle Interaction 

I won't be updating this code anytime soon, I have moved onto using a much simpler simulator I built in PyGame that is more stable and less intensive for my in person participant experiments going forward.

P.S. something is broken with the logging if you load a model to do another round of training on it; all time steps are reset as well as the learning rate and other hyper-parameters (including the replay buffer).
